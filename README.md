# lotr_lcg_companion
A solo pet project of mine. A digitized companion app for the Lord of the Rings living card game that is intended to streamline the token and number management that is required in the game.

Aiming for a simple MVP: clicking "Start Quest" brings user to the quest dashboard, where the user manually enters their hero card statistics (hero name, hit points, resources, etc.) and can adjust them as the game continues. Base version of app will accomodate two players. Also including a modal that will list out the order of operations in a game round.

Once MVP is attained: Hooking into the ringsDB API (https://ringsdb.com/api/) where users will select their heroes and quest they're undertaking, which will then populate the quest dashboard with information from the API, requiring less manual input from the user. Also allowing users to select how many players there are (1-4), and having the dashboard populate the appropriate amount of player cards.

Would also explore Mongo database options to make this a full MERN stack app, for instance, having users create accounts and login, and perhaps being able to save favorite hero combinations and decks.
